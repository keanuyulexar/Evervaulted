    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At Evervaulted, we believe that your legacy deserves security, dignity, and clarity. Our mission is to help people take control of their digital assets, final wishes, and personal messages — ensuring they're protected and passed on exactly how you intended.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      In a world where lives are increasingly digital, traditional wills no longer cover everything. Your social media, online accounts, crypto wallets, and memories need a secure, organized way to be managed — even when you’re not around.
    </p>

    <h2>Built for Families, Backed by Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Evervaulted combines modern encryption, secure cloud architecture, and human-centered design to make will and estate planning accessible, simple, and powerful — for everyone.
